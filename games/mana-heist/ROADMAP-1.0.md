# Mana Heist — Roadmap to public 1.0

**Status:** APPROVED PLANNING BASELINE (documented 2026-10-15); **P01–P15 not yet fully completed as 1.0 acceptance packages**. This is an implementation plan, not a certification that current game mechanics or legal rights are ready for public launch.

**Release-readiness audit and emergency fix · October 19, 2026:** The owner reported game stage buttons no longer open vaults. This was reproduced as a missing `selectedHandId` variable, repaired first in [PR #124](https://github.com/Squackle/deep-cuts-game-lab-/pull/124) and verified by real browser automation through **tap → cast → win → map return** on production SHA `f08c2bef`. The follow-up isolated P03/P06–P10 inventory adds `readiness.html` and offline `scripts/run-readiness-audit.mjs`, reporting all 500 stage definitions, legal reference replays, source-family review candidates and CSV/JSON artifacts with explicit *human QA NOT PERFORMED* statuses. This **does not** prove uniqueness, optimal strategy, educational quality, official rules fidelity, physical device acceptance, artwork rights, or 1.0 readiness. Full gate documentation: [VAULT-READINESS-AUDIT-20261019.md](release/VAULT-READINESS-AUDIT-20261019.md).

**Game Lab progress note · October 19, 2026 (not public 1.0 sign-off):** The current playable test build has **500 stable scored vault IDs across 10 galaxies and 50 worlds**, plus **28 unscored Learn Mana lessons** and **two separately scored local bonus trials**. Five of the later-galaxy scored IDs (mh-251, mh-301, mh-351, mh-401, mh-451) have just received **hand-routed revision-four tactical remixes**; revision-three bests are archived unmodified and surfaced beside new independently scored results. See [the scoped remix release record](release/CERTIFIED-GALAXY-REMIXES-20261019.md) and its tests. This is a **partial P03 puzzle-variety improvement only**: difficulty numbers are structural heuristics rather than player-calibrated ratings, the solver's reference lines are not proven unique/optimal, and the 1.0 teaching/rights/a11y gates remain unfinished. The original 250-stage baseline below describes the October 15 historical audit, **not the present live test inventory**. P01 remains BLOCKED on rights/brand strategy; no main-site promotion is authorized.

**Source of truth for agent workflow:** [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). **Current rules vs proposed rules:** [RULESET-1.0.md](RULESET-1.0.md). **Existing historical playtest log:** [README.md](README.md). Root-level [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [../docs/TEST-FIRST-RELEASE-POLICY.md](../docs/TEST-FIRST-RELEASE-POLICY.md) still apply.

## Mission and positioning

> **Master Magic's mana system, one puzzle at a time.** Learn to play lands, choose colors, sequence turns, and cast spells through short, satisfying challenges.

Position 1.0 as a **focused mana-learning puzzle game**, not an MTG Arena replacement, full match simulator, multiplayer client, deck tester, or complete Magic rules engine. Two intended audiences: newcomers confused by lands vs mana, generic vs colorless, land drops, and untapping; intermediate players seeking deliberate land sequencing, fixing and life-total tradeoffs.

### Scope of the 1.0 promise

- Five galaxies × five worlds × ten levels = **250 playable learning puzzles**.
- Learn Mode (guided onboarding) and Challenge Mode (minimal assistance).
- A three-step hint ladder and **why it worked** explanations.
- Realistic, documented behavior for each *supported* mechanic or an explicitly labeled simplified mechanic. Do not market approximations as Oracle-accurate Magic.
- Large interactive Chromatic Cauldron, readable card interactions on mobile, keyboard/accessibility alternatives, reliable save/export, and optional replay hooks.
- **No public release or integration into monetized Deep Cuts EDH before explicit rights/brand review and a separate owner-approved production promotion.** The existing authentic-card-image Lab prototype is **not** proof of licensing.

## Baseline inventory (not 1.0 acceptance)

| Area | Observed in repository | Gap / caution |
|---|---|---|
| Puzzle atlas | 250 unique IDs, 5 galaxies, 25 worlds, 10 stages/world in `src/levels.js` | First 18 are authored; other **232 are generated** from templates. Legal winning-route replay is necessary, but does NOT prove distinct instructional value, fairness or best solution |
| Game engine | `src/engine.js` has `VERSION="mh-landfall-0.2.0"`, pure `actions`/`reduce`/`payOptions`/validation | Simplified model; no full step/phase loop; mana expires on `end` turn, not every step and phase |
| Land catalog | Real Magic land identities/images are in Lab, with basic, dual, shock, pain, check, fetch, bounce, colorless families | Simic Growth Chamber is currently modeled as U **or** G per tap; real card makes U **and** G. Complete support and Oracle accuracy unverified |
| Casting | Tabletop Flow now defaults to deliberate Cast Spell; `src/auto-cast.js` remains the optional legal payment/auto-cast selector | Both modes use the existing engine, must be verified through the campaign; no mana-output rule change |
| Ward | Stirrable top-down pigment cauldron with precomputed mixtures | Needs polish, perf tuning, non-color cues, sound controls and accessibility alternatives |
| UI | 250-stage overworld, mobile full-card hand, magnifier, drag-to-play, final-turn guidance | Physical iOS/Android testing, keyboard alternative to dragging, focus, visibility and low-height layouts are not complete |
| Progress | Browser-local guest bests (`dc-mana-heist-landfall-v2`) | Export/import and save migration missing; do not reset progress or identifiers |
| Infrastructure | Standalone Cloudflare Game Lab with GitHub CI | Not public website/Arcade, no public leaderboard/auth/D1 integration |

**Important:** Older sections near the start of README describe earlier releases (e.g. original art, manual casting, 18 acts) and are historical, not the current contract. Start with source, tests, and this baseline.

## 15 independent deployment packages

Every package produces: a scoped design/spec or implementation, deterministic tests, review of user-visible copy and mobile UX where relevant, a GitHub PR, a **standalone Game Lab preview**, a concise release/QA/rollback record, and **explicit owner approval for any production deployment or public promotion**. Nothing here grants a standing authorization to deploy each package.

### Phase I — Foundations

| Package | Work | Acceptance/exit gate | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P01 — Release Foundations** | Define supported mechanics and exact 1.0 scope; inventory card art/names, API/assets and IP risks; choose rights/permission or original-assets strategy; review player data/privacy and game branding; baseline mobile/performance | Recorded legal/brand decision, risk register, rules applicability matrix, signed-off acceptance criteria; no public launch until permissions or an independently vetted original presentation | None |
| **P02 — Mana Engine 1.0** | Audit lands, mana abilities, colored vs generic vs true colorless, multiple mana outputs, untapping, turn/step/phase expiration, life/entry costs, legal taps/payment and automatic casting | Every supported land family has source-grounded behavior tests; declared simplifications are conspicuous; no false real-world rules; version/replay and save migration plan; all affected puzzle routes revalidated | P01 |
| **P03 — Puzzle Engine & Validator** | Solver-backed authoring tools, solution replay, effective difficulty, unintended solutions/shortcuts, duplicate-archetype detection, explanation trace and solvability monitoring | Reliable validator distinguishes solvable, impossible and inconclusive; tests cover auto-cast (not only manual cast), cost constraints, alternate pay routes and puzzle uniqueness; CI regression gate | P02 |

**Hard gate G1 (after P03):** The engine and puzzle validator must support the rules *we claim* to teach, with a reviewed, versioned contract and actual tests.

### Phase II — Teaching

| Package | Work | Acceptance/exit gate | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P04 — Learn Mode** | Guided onboarding for land≠mana, tapping, one land drop/turn, colors, generic/colorless, costs and untapping; opt-out/skip; teach without penalty | First 5–10 teaching puzzles have tested step-by-step prompts; learn/challenge settings cannot alter core legal outcomes; suitable touch and keyboard controls | P03 |
| **P05 — Hints & Explanations** | Three-level hints: conceptual nudge → specific sequencing clue → demonstrated solution. Show why a win worked and why a mistaken move failed | Hints are tied to solver-validated routes, do not reveal answers unprompted, honor available mana and turn limits, explain colored/generic costs accurately | P03–P04 |

### Phase III — Five-galaxy curriculum

**Package boundary:** these improve the EXISTING 250 IDs, not an additional 250 levels. Keep `5 × 5 × 10`, old completed progress where possible, world locks, and existing solution/replay guarantees; plan migration if any ID or difficulty is changed. Minimum **50 manually curated/authored anchor puzzles total** (approximately 10 per galaxy), not a claim 250 are hand-authored.

| Package | Galaxy | 50-level teaching focus | Acceptance/exit gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P06 — Foundations** | I | Lands vs mana, basic colors, tapping, generic requirements, turns, land drops | 5 worlds × 10 stages; progressively learn fundamentals; 10 reviewed anchors and an integrative finale |
| **P07 — Color Mastery** | II | Dual lands, mixed costs, true colorless, preserving critical colors, multi-pip requirements | Same 50-stage audit, meaningful decisions, varied cost patterns, explanations |
| **P08 — Complex Lands** | III | Shock/check/pain/fetch land effects, typed lands, entering tapped, life/tempo | Faithful behavior for each included mechanic or explicitly labeled simplified case; all targets/choices verified |
| **P09 — Sequencing** | IV | Planning land drops and turns, life tradeoffs, bounce lands, untaps, chained wards | Decisions cannot be bypassed by an unintended auto-cast shortcut; meaningful planning progression |
| **P10 — Grand Heist** | V | Combined mechanics, challenging color competition, efficient routes, multi-turn/multi-ward mastery | 50 reviewed climax puzzles; final worlds combine 2+ learned mechanics; no softlocks or accidental missing moves |

**Hard gate G2 (after P10):** All 500 currently shipped IDs must eventually be validated as educationally distinguishable and difficulty-calibrated challenges, including the original 250 and the five added Galaxy VI–X chapters. Winning replay alone is insufficient. This gate is NOT COMPLETE.

### Phase IV — Production quality

| Package | Work | Acceptance/exit gate | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P11 — Mobile & Accessibility** | Real iPhone/Android card handling, drag alternatives (tap/select land then tap battlefield), keyboard support, color labels, target size, browser zoom, focus and reduced motion | Real-device smoke at narrow portrait, large phone, tablet/desktop; no unreadable cards, dead controls, trapped scrolling, color-only communication or drag-only critical action | P04–P10 |
| **P12 — Chromatic Cauldron Polish** | Full-color coverage/mixing, injection and finale, sound/mute, optional reduced FX, adaptive 30–60 FPS targets, safe background pause | Color fractions preserved, fluid blend visible, ward mana accurately reflects actual resource state, neutral on turn/end/Undo, mobile fallback stable | P11 |
| **P13 — Progression & Replay** | Reliable save/export/import, medals, achievements/world mastery, optional daily puzzle/share image/result | Save/upgrade compatibility and offline fallback tested; daily challenges are not required for the core 250; no unapproved account/score/production data use | P03/P10 |

### Phase V — Beta and launch

| Package | Work | Acceptance/exit gate | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P14 — Closed Beta & Hardening** | Recruit ~15–20 mixed-experience testers; watch real beginners, log confusions, balance levels, mobile/performance/a11y audit, bug bash | Proposed targets: ≥80% of new testers complete first five guided puzzles without external help; testers explain land/mana, generic/colorless and untapping; no known progression blocker or data-loss bug | P01–P13 |
| **P15 — Mana Heist 1.0 Release** | Freeze rules/content; complete legal/IP clearance, documentation, release branding, SEO, full regression, controlled public promotion and rollback | All G1–G3 checks green; a separately authorized promotion PR verified by website owner and actual live smoke; public site not touched earlier | P14 + legal clearance |

**Hard gate G3 (after P14, before P15):** Public-release rights resolved; real-device accessibility, core teaching value, rules fidelity, progress safety and complete campaign tested. Owner must explicitly authorize public promotion.

## Priorities

- **P0 / must block public release:** rights & branding; supported rules accuracy; campaign solvability; mobile usability; lost progress/softlocks; actual game-breaking defects.
- **P1 / core product:** introductory Learn Mode; structured hints and post-win explanations; 250-stage educational progression; accessible cauldron.
- **P2 / launch extras:** daily puzzle, achievements, shareable results, save export/import, adjustable effects (unless required for accessibility).
- **Post-1.0, not roadmap prerequisites:** opponent/full match simulator, multiplayer, unrestricted deck import, full ranked leaderboard, complex account infrastructure and monetization.

## Release quality gates (for every package)

1. **Owner authorization:** research/documentation may be prepared on request; do not assume approval of all 15 packages, Game Lab production deployments, or public site integration.
2. **Isolation:** `Squackle/deep-cuts-game-lab-` (trailing hyphen), `mana-heist/**` only. Any shared `lab/**` or main-site change needs separate explicit approval/coordination.
3. **Coordination:** check current main SHA and open PRs; create fresh feature branch; never overwrite another agent's work.
4. **Rules fidelity:** use the pure reducer/legal action list as authority. Tests must prove intended behavior; avoid changing card abilities without editing levels, hints, solver and save/replay treatment.
5. **Tests:** `node --test mana-heist/tests/*.test.mjs` plus relevant syntax checks, solver replay, deliberate casting with optional auto-cast, mobile fallback, keyboard/touch, and smoke for the feature.
6. **Preview first:** require successful GitHub CI and Cloudflare **Game Lab preview** before merging; check the actual user-visible UI. A merged PR/deployment stage alone is not a browser smoke test.
7. **Release evidence:** record commit SHA, PR, changed paths, exact test results, preview/live URL, known limitations and rollback.
8. **Versioning:** record engine/rules version and migration impact; preserve legacy `dc-mana-heist-landfall-v2` until a tested migration.
9. **Public gate:** NEVER promote Magic assets / gameplay to public Deep Cuts EDH or attach accounts, D1, scores, ads or production ranks without separate review and explicit authorization.
10. **Doc upkeep:** mark each package `NOT STARTED`, `IN PROGRESS`, `PREVIEW VERIFIED`, `LAB MERGED`, `BLOCKED`, or `OWNER APPROVED FOR PUBLIC` with PR/commit evidence. Do not check it off because code exists in the old prototype.

## Consolidated prelaunch Game Lab progress note — October 19, 2026

Following the owner's request to deploy the remaining phases together, the isolated Mana Heist workstream packaged **three independently testable partial capabilities in one release**: [state-verified three-step optional hints (P05), reduced animated effects (P12) and derived guest milestones (P13)](release/CONSOLIDATED-PRELAUNCH-BUNDLE-20261019.md). Existing save export/import, keyboard/mobile changes, QA collection and 500-stage replay coverage remain unchanged. This does **not** mark P01–P15 complete: the 500-stage curriculum lacks independent human curation/calibration, full rules audit remains open, real device and 15–20-person beta evidence are missing, and P01 image/brand rights remain BLOCKED. G1, G2, G3 and P15 public promotion therefore remain BLOCKED. Read the bundle release record for an explicit 15-package gap ledger and rollback.

## Status ledger for future agents

| Package | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| P01 | BLOCKED | P01 technical foundation delivered for Lab: [scope/risk register](release/FOUNDATIONS-P01.md), [mechanics audit](release/MECHANICS-MATRIX-P01.md), [asset/rights decision](release/ASSET-RIGHTS-P01.md), [baseline tests](tests/release-foundations.test.mjs). **Rights route, title review and owner sign-off unresolved; not public-release cleared.** |
| P02 | IN PROGRESS | [Mana Engine 2.0 / mana spells extension](release/SAGE-MANA-DEPTH-20261017.md) adds legal Dark Ritual and Pyretic Ritual casts from hand, generic/colorless fee choices and large-mana payment optimization. Existing saves remain, new capstone bests are versioned. **Full steps/phases, stack, abilities and final Oracle audit NOT COMPLETE.** |
| P03 | IN PROGRESS | [30 late-board legal action certificates](release/SAGE-MANA-DEPTH-20261017.md) now prove replayable solves; these are reference routes, NOT demonstrated globally optimal, uniquely strategic or empirically calibrated. **Remaining 202 generated variants, global optimizer and clone detection NOT COMPLETE.** |
| P04 | IN PROGRESS | [26 authored lessons and contextual Sage Notes](release/SAGE-MANA-DEPTH-20261017.md): original 18 preserved, eight added for rocks, Signets, rituals, filters and scaling, separately unscored and solver checked. Full progressive 1.0 curriculum and beginner usability testing are not yet complete. |
| P05 | IN PROGRESS | [Sage Notes / Sage's Whisper](release/SAGE-MANA-DEPTH-20261017.md) add 26 state-aware lesson tips and optional linked guidance after two puzzle restarts. **Three-level spoiler controls, solver proof explanations and validation NOT COMPLETE.** |
| P06 | NOT STARTED | 50-stage baseline exists but not curriculum reviewed |
| P07 | NOT STARTED | 50-stage baseline exists but not curriculum reviewed |
| P08 | IN PROGRESS | [Ten revised Galaxy III late stages](release/SAGE-MANA-DEPTH-20261017.md) introduce ritual and black-mana engines. **Other 40 stages, empirical difficulty curve and full review NOT COMPLETE.** |
| P09 | IN PROGRESS | [Ten revised Galaxy IV late stages](release/SAGE-MANA-DEPTH-20261017.md) combine paid conversion, sacrifice and Coffers/Nykthos. **Other 40 stages and full review NOT COMPLETE.** |
| P10 | IN PROGRESS | [Ten revised Galaxy V late stages](release/SAGE-MANA-DEPTH-20261017.md) with full 12-source last-vault finale, legal reference routes and high colored-cost requirements. **Other 40 stages, optimal-path proof and full review NOT COMPLETE.** |
| P11 | NOT STARTED | Prior mobile fixes ≠ full real-device/accessibility acceptance |
| P12 | IN PROGRESS | [Tabletop card/lesson/result hotfix](release/SAGE-MANA-DEPTH-20261017.md) aligns rotated full-card art, hides stale card previews on wins, provides compact results and mobile 12-source swipe rack while preserving large cauldron/orbits. **Physical-device, accessibility/performance, audio and final polish NOT COMPLETE.** |
| P13 | NOT STARTED | Current guest bests ≠ save export/daily/achievements package |
| P14 | NOT STARTED | Beta not performed |
| P15 | NOT STARTED | Public launch not authorized or cleared |

## Planning timeline

**Estimated 12–16 weeks** for concentrated work; not a delivery promise. Legal/licensing and engine fidelity investigations can materially extend it. Package sequence and gates matter more than dates. Prioritize P01–P03 before large-scale lesson writing.

## P01 technical delivery handoff (2026-10-15)

**Technical baseline and artifacts completed; package status: BLOCKED pending owner choice/rights review.** See [release/FOUNDATIONS-P01.md](release/FOUNDATIONS-P01.md) for release scope, AC-01–AC-12, privacy baseline and R-01–R-10 risks; [release/MECHANICS-MATRIX-P01.md](release/MECHANICS-MATRIX-P01.md) for 24 lands and 19 mechanics with mandatory P02 audit; and [release/ASSET-RIGHTS-P01.md](release/ASSET-RIGHTS-P01.md) for a recorded licensing-vs-original-asset decision awaiting approval. The main-game 250 levels, artwork, engine and score storage were not altered. **P02 is not authorized by this delivery.** A rights/brand decision cannot be signed off by an automated agent.

### P12 partial work — fluid parity patch (2026-10-15)

User-directed focused parity improvement after iPhone footage review: time-normalized fluid velocity, mixing and turbulence tuned to preserve the original 30fps mobile feel at desktop refresh rates; interpolated desktop hover strokes and touch gestures; responsive 256/512px Canvas resolution; equal auto-cast grace, without changing the 5.1-second maximum. New `tests/stir-parity.test.mjs` exercises cross-FPS decay and both pointer modes. **P12 stays IN PROGRESS**: the complete package still requires optional sound/mute, reduced-FX settings, real iPhone/Android and desktop performance measurements, broader visual polish, accessibility and owner review. P01 remains blocked by its separate public release rights decision. This focused Game Lab fix is not a public-site promotion or completed 1.0 milestone.

## Owner-authorized Mana Mastery expansion (Oct 17, 2026)

The owner explicitly requested one-tap hand play, separate numeric Complexity and Difficulty ratings, preservation of the old final as the **Galaxy V / 250th vault midpoint**, and harder challenges beyond it. [Implementation and verification](release/MANA-MASTERY-TEN-GALAXIES-20261017.md) expands the catalog to **ten galaxies, 50 worlds and 500 vaults**, with 250 newly certified Galaxy VI–X mana-circuit scenarios. New galaxies add two, three, four, five and six wards over one to three turns. All old IDs and solutions remain unchanged. The old finale calibrates both scores at 50/100; the new finale scores 100/100.

**P03 and P13 remain IN PROGRESS**: the numeric indicators are structural and estimated, not empirical player completion rates; 250 new puzzles share a certified core strategy, varying cost division, alternate source families and optional resource decisions. A 500-stage catalog is not evidence of 500 bespoke, uniquely difficult experiences. Further solver optimality, true alternate-line analysis and live user testing are required for the revised G2 gate. P01 rights approval remains BLOCKED; Game Lab only.

## Owner-requested source variety and Oracle catalog (Oct 17, 2026)

The owner specifically rejected repeated Dark Ritual/Coffers circuits across the 250 advanced vaults. This [limited, test-branch implementation](release/MANA-CATALOG-AND-VARIETY-20261017.md) adds an **offline Scryfall Oracle Cards bulk candidate discovery/exporter**, 21 more playable mana spell/artifact identities, authentic conditional mana and targeted untap effects, and a new **five-strategy rotation within every 10-vault Galaxy VI–X world**. The new final vault incorporates High Tide, Mana Geyser, Rite of Flame, Chromatic Lantern, Basalt Monolith and Voltaic Key across three turns instead of repeating one spell. Puzzle definitions for mh-001..mh-250 are unchanged.

**G2/P02/P03 still NOT COMPLETE:** broad Scryfall candidate identification is not equivalent to complete Oracle implementation. The full bulk export has not yet been downloaded; individual playable card families need review against current Oracle rules, including partial card text and unsupported side effects. Later worlds still use recurring *families*, not 250 individually authored independent strategies; optimal solutions and observed player difficulty remain unproven. Continue no-rights/public-promotion status P01 BLOCKED. New scores are version 3 under `dc-mana-heist-variety-v1`, old medals remain archived.

## 20 October 2026 — scoped game-quality audit

Owner-requested gameplay/presentation audit: [layout QA and difficulty findings](release/GAME-QUALITY-2026-10-20.md). Phone heading/status overlap corrected on a review branch; 215 tests and three local Chromium viewport cases pass. This is partial P11/P14 evidence only. Neither increasing reasoning difficulty nor the full educational curriculum is certified; shipped ratings/rules/puzzles/saves remain unchanged. No deployment or milestone completion claimed.
